This application enables you to use USB Webcams to track a light source in 3D.
The intended application for this is for VR headtracking.
At the moment it allows you to write and draw in the air in 3 Dimensions.

In order to use the application you will need to calibrate the cameras, this is done by moving a light source within sight of all cameras and hitting the calibrate button.

To use this application you need 2 or more PS3 eye Webcams.
I am using it with 4 PS3 Eye Webcams, it should accept as many cameras as your computer is able to process.
